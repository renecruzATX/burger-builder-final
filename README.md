# Burger Builder

## Project Background

**Burger Builder** was my final graduation project at Austin Coding Academy.  It is a single page full stack web app built with the MERN stack where you can customize a delicious hamburger and order it online for delivery. Enjoy!

## Benefits of Project

Burger Builder helps familiarize yourself with the inner workings of React JS.  It is a fairly involved project but I believe still allows you to start from the App.js file in the client folder and trace your way through each component learning what each one does.  One of the advantages of React is the componentization of each element in the program.  It allows for less code repetition and to maintain continuity throughout the project if new features come up.  

## Objectives for this project

* Create a full stack single page web app built with the MERN stack

* Learn the React workflow and best practices

* Manage state in class based components and also with the Redux library

* Write simple RESTful APIs with NodeJS and the Express web framework to serve data to the React front end

* Use an MVC framework to organize the server side code

* Implement a mongoDB database using the Mongoose library to house orders, login credentials and customer data

## Outcome

Burger Builder is a well designed starter MERN stack project with a detached front and back end where you can begin to understand the benefits of React JS. This project also gives you the beginnings of writing simple RESTful APIs with NodeJS and shows how to organize the back end.

## Assumptions

This project assumes that you have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Docs for each library and framework used are linked below
