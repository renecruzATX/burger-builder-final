# Burger Builder

**Burger Builder** was my final graduation project at Austin Coding Academy.  It is a single page web app where you can customize a delicious hamburger and order it online for delivery. Enjoy!

## Build Tools

Burger Builder is a full stack single page web application built with React JS on the front-end, Redux for state management, NodeJS for CRUD operations and mongoDB for the back-end database. It also employed an MVC framework on the back end.
