Burger Builder
Burger Builder was my final graduation project at Austin Coding Academy.  It is a single page web app where you can customize a delicious hamburger and order it online for delivery. Enjoy!
Build Tools
Burger Builder is a full stack single page web application built with React JS on the front-end, Redux for state management, NodeJS for CRUD operations and mongoDB for the back-end database. Materialize was used for styling, in addition to implementing the Typed.js library for typing effects.
